		This site first of all has really good graphics, and has good flow with the top menu, which brings drop down menus. Then, it does good by having a list on the left side with content still on the right side. The search button in the upper right, and logo in the upper left are nice. Though it doesn't have a great transition from the top side search/logo area into the main content area on the side background. <br>
		There are tons of elements/tags I don't recognize. I do see JavaScript and CSS in there. I recognize the syntax for the lists, the links, images, div and a bunch of others.
